Summary

The SHAP analysis shows that model prediction in majority are driven by four key parameters in this order:
property size (squareMeters), location (city), construction year (buildYear), and proximity to the city center (centreDistance). Prices also show some monthly fluctuations.
Secondary features include mostly amenities like elevators, balconies and proximity to various points of interest, with most influence being held by schools, clinics and restaurants.
While these secondary features have smaller effects, they refine the modelâ€™s estimates by capturing practical and contextual factors that influence property value.
